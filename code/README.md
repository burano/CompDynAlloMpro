# Visualization
In order to generate the figures place scripts into 'data' directory and then run.
For example, to generate the cross-correlation and distance maps enter in terminal
'python plot-crosscor_dist.py'
or run the cript in IDE, like [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) available in [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution. 

## plot-crosscor_dist.py
Plots cross-correlation and distance maps for apo, holo1 and holo2 6LU7 structure forms.

## plot-1point_mut.py
Plots 1-point mutational maps for relative fluctuation free energy change and global allosteric control for 6LU7 ENM.

## plot-2point_mut.py
Plots 2-point mutational maps for relative fluctuation free energy change and global allosteric control for 6LU7 ENM at k<sub>R</sub>/k=0.25 and 4.00.
