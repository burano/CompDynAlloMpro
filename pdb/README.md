# PDB
PDB files for each form were created form [6LU7](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6LU7) structure with manual deletion of undesired 'HETATOM' lines in the file.
Note, all water molecules `H2O` were removed from all protein structure PDB files.

## 6lu7_apo.pdb
Ligand-free form of 6LU7 structure.

## 6lu7_holo1.pdb
Single-ligand form of 6LU7 structure. The ligand, a alpha-ketoamide inhibitor, is present only on chain A of the protein homodimer.

## 6lu7_holo2.pdb
Double-ligand form of 6LU7 structure. The ligand, a alpha-ketoamide inhibitor, is present only on both chains A and B of the protein homodimer.
